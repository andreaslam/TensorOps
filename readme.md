## Setting up TensorOps

Firstly, to use this repo, use git clone to make the Repository available locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/andreaslam/TensorOps.git
```

At the root of the repository, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building the Backend

To compile the Rust OpenCL backend, `maturin` is needed. If not installed already, run:

```
pip install maturin
```

Then run:
```
cd tensorops
maturin develop --release
```

The backend should be installed into 


Support for non-OpenCL backend is still in progress. PRs welcome.

## Getting started with TensorOps

There are some examples available in the [examples folder](https://github.com/andreaslam/TensorOps/tree/main/examples)

Most examples implemented in the examples folder, will have a corresponding [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) implementation for comparison and juxtaposition.

## TensorOps Features

### Node (Deprecating)
- Forward pass
- Backward pass
- Node weight and gradient tracking (enable/disable)
- Arithmetic operations (BIDMAS, negation, exponentiation, modulo, [several Python reverse operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types))
- Non-linear activation functions (sin, cos, tanh, ReLU, sigmoid, ramp)
- Lazy evaluation
